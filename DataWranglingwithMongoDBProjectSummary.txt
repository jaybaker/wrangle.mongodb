Feedback:
I do not have anything to convey about the project that is important for the evaluator to know in order to assess my project.
The only feedback I have is that I had a sense that the project seemed a little bit backwards. We have the data, now go find a problem. Usually it is the other way around, here is a problem, is there some data that can help solve it? I think this is more interesting and closer to how things really come up. But I understand that in a course like setting, there are constraints that led to this approach. In the end it was fine.
